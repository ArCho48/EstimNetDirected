# EstimNetDirected

EstimNetDirected implements the Equilibrium Expectation (EE) algorithm for estimating parameters of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) for large directed networks.

The source code is written in C and (optionally) uses MPI to run multiple estimations in parallel. It was written on a Linux cluster system with OpenMPI but should be portable to any system with a standard C compiler (it works on cygwin under Windows for example). It uses the Random123 library for random number generation. 

Also included is a simple Python demonstration implementation. The Python implementation uses the NumPy library for vector and matrix data types and functions. In addition, there are R scripts for estimating standard errors and plotting results from the output.

For more information, and the original implementation for undirected networks, see http://www.estimnet.org/.

As well as some simulated networks, as an empirical example, the political bloggers network from the paper:

is included. This network was downloaded from Mark Newman's network data page.
